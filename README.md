## About

MSc in **Computational Science & Engineering** at EPFL (BSc Mechanical Engineering, EPFL).  
I work at the intersection of **numerical methods, scientific computing, and data-driven modeling** to solve engineering problems in aerodynamics and motorsport.

Focus areas include:
- Formula 1 & motorsport engineering  
- Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)  
- Numerical analysis & simulation  
- Structural engineering  
- Machine learning for engineering systems
